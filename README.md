# Sample Astro Project

## Project Info
This is a project made with the Astro web framework.  I started off by following the getting started tutorial on [astro.build](astro.build) in 2023.  The original project can be found [here](https://github.com/davelongdev/astro-blog-project).

## Continuation

After I finished the tutorial, I added some additional customizations and functionality.  I was using this as my developer website for a while.  Now it's just a sample project and a template for making sites with Astro.

This project is live [here](https://astro-site-template.vercel.app/).
